## Hi, I'm Christian ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD candidate at the Sociology Department of Utrecht University. My GitHub is a mixture of research code and personal data analysis projects, which I write about on my blog, [https://christianfang95.github.io](https://christianfang95.github.io). 

## Research 

 - My "substantive" PhD research considers how parents and children perceive living in postdivorce families. To do so, I analyze existing data and literature to identify research gaps to generate hypotheses. I test the resulting hypotheses using diverse quantitative methods, such as (linear/logisitc) regression models.
 
 - I also take great interest in methodological and statistical research. Currently, I am working with colleagues on a paper using simulation studies to investigate the appropriateness of the "Linear Probability Model" under varying conditions (e.g., different data generation processes, magnitudes of effects, presence of interaction effects, bivariate correlations betweeen variables).
 
## Data Science projects

I use Python (and, to an extent, R and Stata) to generate insights from data (be that existing data or simulated data). You can check out some projects on my [blog](https://christianfang95.github.io).

## Teaching materials

I implement some common statistical models (e.g., linear regression with OLS) from scratch in Python and post the implementations with lots and lots of text describing what's going on mathematically and "in code" here on GitHub (and sometimes as Jupyter notebooks) as well as on my blog. 

- OLS regression: [GitHub](https://github.com/christianfang95/datascienceprojects/blob/main/ols-regression/ols-regression.ipynb);  [Blog](https://christianfang95.github.io/posts/2022/09/regression-scratch/)

- ROC and AUC using simulated logistic regression data [GitHub](https://github.com/christianfang95/datascienceprojects/tree/main/roc-auc);  [Blog](https://christianfang95.github.io/posts/2022/09/roc-auc/)
